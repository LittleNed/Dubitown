# Bugs
* Boardbot boss may be a remnant from an older Altis version (CBBHQ?)
* Suit paths in BDHQ are in the wrong place (stuff was probably changed around quite a bit, it was shown in a video from the log leak)
* Prepostera in BDHQ probably at 0, 0, 0 (was shown in the same video, beta event leftover?)
* Alot of links still redirect to Altis and idk what to do with them
* Beta event isn't functional (IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!)
* Boardbot HQ collision is broken as heck
* BDHQ spawn position needs to be added so it doesnt spawn you in the castle
* BDHQ doors work wrong (the entrance is on the wrong side)
* Random crashes that I have no idea about (dont think its memory leaks so what could it be?)
* Whatever bugs happen with walking your doodle
* On my (toonjoeys) end when a song from the jukebox stops and another one is going to play theres a wait of 3(?) seconds
* If you change the window size while text is onscreen the text gets corrupted for a second
* Add textures for the doors/paintings in BDHQ (currently just vertex colors)
