# Bugs
* Boardbot boss may be a remnant from an older Altis version (CBBHQ?)
* Suit paths in BDHQ are in the wrong place (stuff was probably changed around quite a bit, it was shown in a video from the log leak)
* Prepostera in BDHQ probably at 0, 0, 0 (was shown in the same video)
* Alot of links still redirect to Altis and idk what to do with them
* Beta event isn't functional (IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!)
