# these are just some ideas for new tweaks that i have in mind

whether itd be new playgrounds or literally just some simple fixes

* delfino plaza as a playground (probably name it disyerno plaza or something (dubito plaza?))
* remixed music for delfino plaza (already started work on remixing the plaza theme)
* maybe we could try to reimplement cardboardbots and their hq? probably not but idk
* fix the cog paths for boardbot hq (pretty simple i can help line them up)
* try to get the beta event working to start on the dubito based event rocket had in mind
* project altis exposed as the main theme (this is simple)
* redone toon tips
* revert the design changes for the boardbots
* super mario 64 remixes for the ost (easy as heck)

these are all just random ideas i thought of so i dont care if they dont get in or something
